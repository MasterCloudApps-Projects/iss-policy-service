# iss-policy-service

We decided to implement it in an extremely simplified version of an insurance sales system to test the following aspects of microservice development:

* Project creation and development
* Access of both relational and NoSQL databases
* Blocking and non-blocking operations implementation
* Microservice to microservice communication (synchronous and asynchronous)
* Service discovery
* Running background jobs
